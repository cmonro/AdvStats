# Visit Sussex

![Falmer House at The University of Sussex](images/University-of-Sussex.webp)

A leading research institution, located in the beautiful and scenic South Downs National Park, what better place to study than [The University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/). From scientific discovery to global policy, from student welfare to career development, Sussex innovates and takes a lead. There are so many reasons to visit Sussex.

## Beautiful and Scenic

Sussex campus is located in the South Downs National park and offers stunning views of the rolling hills and beautiful green spaces.

Academia is as thriving as it has always been as exemplified by the passionate lecturers at Sussex

## Good to know!

Sussex contributes to open science by paying to publish in big-name journals and also paying to access them! For example, access to articles such as @Fortunato2021 are included in my tuition fee!

## Great Value Food

Sussex offers many food options that anyone would be envious of.

## Loving Sussex Just Makes Sense!

$\text{Loving Sussex}=\hat{b}_{StockholmSyndrome}+\hat{b}_{SunkCostFallacy}+\varepsilon$

Who could argue with maths like that?

## We Have Data To Prove It

I made up this data and presented it using @tidyverse:

```{r}

library(readr)
library(kableExtra)

df <- readxl::read_excel('/cloud/project/data/FakeSussexLoveData.xlsx')
colnames(df)[1] <- "Participant"

df |>
  dplyr::sample_n(20) |> 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Data of student's love for their university", digits = 2) |> 
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

And ran a T test on the data:

```{r}
colnames(df)[3] <- "university_love"
df$University <- as.factor(df$University)
t.test(university_love~University, data=df)
```

A significant p value means it's true. Right?

## Finally, a message from me:

Everything in the above document was intended to be a light-hearted parody and no ill intent or malice went into making it. I love Sussex and consider myself very lucky to be able to study here.
